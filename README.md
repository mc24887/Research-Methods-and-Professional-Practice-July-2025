## **Unit 3: Introduction to Programming Languages: Activity - Buffer Overflow Activities – C and Python**

### **Part I: C Code – `bufoverflow.c`**

#### **Code Analysis**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char buf[8]; // buffer for eight characters
    printf("enter name:");
    gets(buf);   // read from stdin (vulnerable function)
    printf("%s\n", buf); // print out data stored in buf
    return 0;    // 0 as return value
}
```

- **Key Issue**: `buf` is allocated for 8 bytes, but `gets()` does not perform boundary checks.
- **Security Flaw**: Classic buffer overflow vulnerability if the user inputs more than 7 characters plus a null terminator.

#### **Compilation & Execution**

1. Compile

   ```
   gcc bufoverflow.c -o bufoverflow
   ```

2. Run:

   ```
   ./bufoverflow
   ```

- **When input ≤ 8 chars**: Prints back the input typically.
- **When input > 8 chars**: Triggers undefined behaviour. Modern systems often detect a "stack smashing" attempt, terminating the program.

#### **Observations**

- Output for Short Input:

  ```
  name: John
  John
  ```

- Output for Long Input (≥10 characters):

  ```
  stack smashing detected ***: terminated
  Aborted (core dumped)
  ```

  Or it may produce a segmentation fault or corrupt memory.

------

### **Part II: Python Code – `Overflow.py`**

#### **Code Analysis**

```
buffer = [None] * 10
for i in range(0, 11):
    buffer[i] = 7
print(buffer)
```

- Creates a list `buffer` of length 10.
- Attempts to assign a value to indices 0 through 10 (`range(0, 11)`), which leads to an out-of-bounds assignment on the final iteration.

#### **Execution & Result**

```
python overflow.py
```

- Python immediately raises an `IndexError`:

  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "overflow.py", line X, in <module>
      buffer[i] = 7
  IndexError: list assignment index out of range
  ```

- **No Memory Corruption**: Python’s runtime prevents accidental overwriting of adjacent memory locations.

------

## Unit 4: Introduction to Testing

#### Linters and Cyclomatic Complexity: Questions and Reflections

#### 1. **Run `styleLint.py`. What happens when the code is run? Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome? What amendments have you made to the code?**

### Observations & Answers

1. **Running `styleLint.py`:**

   - Typically, `styleLint.py` is a sample script that checks basic stylistic or formatting conventions.
   - Depending on how it is implemented, it might print warnings about indentation, naming conventions, or unused imports when executed.

2. **Modifying `styleLint.py` for a More Favourable Outcome:**

   - **Likely Amendments**:

     - Fixing indentation (e.g., using 4 spaces consistently).
     - Renaming variables to adhere to Pythonic naming conventions (e.g., `lower_case_with_underscores`).
     - Removing redundant or commented-out lines of code.

   - **Example**: If `styleLint.py` had:

     ```
     def BadFunctionName():
         Print('Hello')
     ```

     We might rename the function and correct print usage:

     ```
     def good_function_name():
         print('Hello')
     ```

   - After these adjustments, re-running the script should reduce or eliminate style warnings.

------

#### 2. Running Pylint on `pylintTest.py`

1) Install pylint (`pip install pylint`).
2) Run `pylint` on `pylintTest.py`.
3) Review each of the code errors returned. Can you correct them?
4) Save the original `pylintTest.py` before fixing it.

#### Observations & Answers

1. Errors Identified by Pylint:
   - Common Errors:
     - Naming violations (function names not in snake_case).
     - Indentation errors or trailing whitespace.
     - Unused variables/imports.
     - Missing docstrings.
   - **Severity**: Pylint categorises issues as convention (C), warning (W), error (E), etc.
2. Correcting the Errors:
   - **Renamed** improperly named variables or functions to meet snake_case conventions.
   - **Removed** unused imports.
   - **Added** docstrings or comments where required.
   - **Fixed** indentation to adhere to 4-space or tab consistency.
3. Outcome:
   - The newly saved file (e.g. `pylintTest_fixed.py`) should have fewer or no pylint complaints, resulting in a higher pylint score (e.g., `10/10` if fully compliant).

------

#### 3. Running Flake8 on `pylintTest.py` and `metricTest.py`

1) Install flake8 (`pip install flake8`).
2) Run `flake8 pylintTest.py`.
3) Compare the error messages with pylint’s.
4) Run `flake8 metricTest.py` and correct the errors. What amendments did you make?

#### Observations & Answers

1. Flake8 vs. Pylint Errors:
   - **flake8** focuses on style and PEP8 compliance (e.g., line length, whitespace, and formatting).
   - **pylint** also checks code logic (unused variables, naming issues, docstrings, etc.) and often provides more detailed feedback.
2. Differences in Error Messages:
   - flake8 typically returns fewer categories of issues, focusing on format warnings (e.g., `E501 line too long`, `E302 expected 2 blank lines`).
   - pylint might detail additional warnings (e.g., `unused-variable`, `invalid-name`).
3. Fixing Code in `metricTest.py`:
   - Likely Fixes:
     - Reducing line lengths to 79 or 88 characters.
     - Adding or removing blank lines.
     - Correcting indentation levels.
     - Ensuring no trailing whitespace or extra blank lines.

------

#### 4. Running McCabe (`mccabe`) on `sums.py` and `sums2.py`

1) Install mccabe (`pip install mccabe`).
2) Run `mccabe sums.py` and note the cyclomatic complexity.
3) Run `mccabe sums2.py` and compare.
4) What contributes to the cyclomatic complexity in each code snippet?

### Observations & Answers

1. Cyclomatic Complexity:
   - This metric calculates the number of linearly independent paths through the code.
   - Formally, `CC = E - N + 2`, where E is the number of edges and N the number of nodes in the flow graph.
2. Results:
   - `sums.py` might produce a lower (or moderate) complexity because it potentially contains fewer decision points (`if`, `for`, `while`).
   - `sums2.py` might have extra loops or conditional statements, resulting in a higher complexity rating.
3. Contributors to Complexity:
   - **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
   - **Loops** (`for`, `while`).
   - **Logical Operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) used in conditionals.

If `sums2.py` introduced additional branching structures, that explains its higher cyclomatic complexity.

------

#### 5. Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today 

**Is cyclomatic complexity still relevant for modern secure software development? Justify your argument.**

#### Reflections

1. Arguments For Relevance:
   - **Maintainability**: High complexity often means the code is more complex to test and debug (Gill and Kemerer, 1991).
   - **Bug/Defect Rates**: Empirical studies show that modules with high cyclomatic complexity correlate with higher defect rates (McConnell, 2004).
   - **Testing Coverage**: Identifying how many independent paths exist ensures thorough testing.
2. Arguments Against or Caveats:
   - **Modern Practices**: Agile, continuous integration, and advanced frameworks can sometimes reduce the direct need for complexity metrics.
   - **Microservices and Cloud**: Code bases might be smaller and more modular, thus each piece is less complex by design.
   - **Automated Tools**: Tools perform many code checks, so manual tracking of CC can be seen as redundant or less frequently emphasised.
3. Relevance to Secure Software:
   - **Attack Vectors**: More complex code can hide vulnerabilities or make them difficult to spot. Lower complexity can enhance readability and security reviews (Howard and Lipner, 2006).
   - **Principle of Least Privilege & Minimised Attack Surface**: Aligns conceptually with simpler, more modular code.

Therefore, while not a silver bullet, **cyclomatic complexity** remains a valuable metric, particularly for highlighting potential risk areas in code security and maintainability. It should be one tool among many—such as code reviews, static analysis, and dynamic testing—supporting secure software development.

## Unit 5: Future Trends in Secure Software Development of the module: Moving Beyond Microservices

#### Introduction

Building on the microservices paradigm, modern software development has shifted towards architectures that streamline deployment, enhance scalability, and embed security throughout the development lifecycle (Lewis and Fowler, 2014). This shift is driven by the rising complexity of distributed systems, the need for rapid feature releases, and an increasingly significant focus on secure software practices (Souppaya and Scarfone, 2016). Containers, serverless computing, and service meshes represent key advancements that extend beyond traditional microservices, enabling teams to concentrate on application logic rather than infrastructure management.

#### Containerisation and Orchestration

Containers, popularised by technologies such as Docker, encapsulate applications and their dependencies to maintain consistent environments across development, testing, and production (Pahl, 2015). Coupled with orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, containers can be automatically scaled, monitored, and updated, resulting in greater operational efficiency and reliability (Kubernetes, 2023).

#### Serverless and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

Serverless computing, often delivered via Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), reduces infrastructure overhead by allowing developers to deploy discrete functions that run solely in response to events or triggers (AWS, 2023). This approach offers cost-effectiveness—billing only for actual execution—and expedites feature delivery by removing the need for teams to manage the underlying infrastructure (Eivy, 2017).

#### Service Mesh and Observability

Service meshes like Istio add a dedicated infrastructure layer to manage service-to-service communication, enforce security policies, and collect telemetry data (IBM, 2022). Coupled with observability tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana), they enable teams to maintain detailed insights into distributed systems, aiding in proactive performance management and rapid incident response (NIST, 2019).

#### Conclusion

Modern software development continues to evolve beyond microservices to embrace container orchestration, serverless computing, and advanced service mesh solutions. These innovations align with industry-wide demands for agility, scalability, and integrated security strategies. Forward-thinking organisations must adapt to these paradigms to ensure efficient workflows and robust security postures in an era of increasingly complex distributed environments.

#### Formative Activity: RESTful API Creation

#### API Code

```
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse
 
app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)
 
users = [
    {
        "name": "James",
        "age": 30,
        "occupation": "Network Engineer"
    },
    {
        "name": "Ann",
        "age": 32,
        "occupation": "Doctor"
    },
    {
        "name": "Jason",
        "age": 22,
        "occupation": "Web Developer"
    }
]
 
class User(Resource):
    def get(self, name):
        for user in users:
            if(name == user["name"]):
                return user, 200
        return "User not found", 404
 
    def post(self, name):
        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()
        parser.add_argument("age")
        parser.add_argument("occupation")
        args = parser.parse_args()
 
        for user in users:
            if(name == user["name"]):
                return "User with name {} already exists".format(name), 400
 
        user = {
            "name": name,
            "age": args["age"],
            "occupation": args["occupation"]
        }
        users.append(user)
        return user, 201
 
    def put(self, name):
        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()
        parser.add_argument("age")
        parser.add_argument("occupation")
        args = parser.parse_args()
 
        for user in users:
            if(name == user["name"]):
                user["age"] = args["age"]
                user["occupation"] = args["occupation"]
                return user, 200
        
        user = {
            "name": name,
            "age": args["age"],
            "occupation": args["occupation"]
        }
        users.append(user)
        return user, 201
 
    def delete(self, name):
        global users
        users = [user for user in users if user["name"] != name]
        return "{} is deleted.".format(name), 200
      
api.add_resource(User, "/user/<string:name>")
 
app.run(debug=True)
```

## Questions and Answers

### Question 1

**Which command was used to run the `api.py` code, and what did you observe?**

- Answer : The script can be run with:

  ```
  python api.py
  ```

  This command starts the Flask development server on

  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  ```

  displaying real-time logs in the terminal to confirm the API is active.

### Question 2

**What happens when the command `w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Ann` is run, and why?**

- **Answer**: The `w3m` command sends a GET request, returning Ann’s user details in JSON with a **200 (OK)** status. Since “Ann” is present in the `user's` list, her information is successfully retrieved.

### Question 3

**What happens when the command `w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Adam` is run, and why?**

- **Answer**: The API returns **“User not found”** and a **404 (Not Found)** status. There is no user named “Adam” in the `users` list, so the resource cannot be located.

### Question 4

**What capability is achieved by the Flask library?**

- **Answer**: Flask streamlines the creation of web applications and APIs by providing lightweight scaffolding for routing, request handling, and templating (Grinberg, 2018). When extended with Flask-RESTful, it allows for straightforward endpoint definition and parsing of JSON-based requests.
